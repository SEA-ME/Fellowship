# Full Stack Expert


## Full Stack Automotive Software Expert Fellowship (pro bono) for a Non-Profit Educational Organization building an innovative mobility curriculum

We are an **innovative non-profit educational organization** seeking motivated and skilled software developers to join us as volunteer program fellows. Fellows are crucial for us in designing and maintaining the **first ever mobility software development curriculum that is based on peer-based learning** by students instead of teaching. 

*Research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria. Meanwhile, women or people with protected characteristics often only apply if they check every box. So if you feel you could be great for this role but don’t meet every single item on the list, please get in touch either way. We’d love to work out the potential together.*

Our new **“SEA:ME (Software Engineering in Automotive and Mobility Ecosystems)” curriculum builds on the tested peer-based learning system of the 42 Network** - and is the first advanced mobility curriculum that focuses broadly on diverse ecosystems of future (software-driven) mobility. Which include many different types of vehicles, modes, and services. And enable broader access to and choice of mobility for people of all backgrounds and environments. **I.e.: We code the future of mobility. And want to include as many experts / practitioners** from mobility companies as possible. 

**Volunteer fellows can also benefit from their participation** by becoming part of an expert community, exchanging knowledge, ideas and activities with colleagues from different companies / neighboring work fields - and by sharing in the ideas and innovation coming out of our community of students, experts, and staff. **We are specifically building our new curriculum on the basis of a lively community that drives both the successful learning of the students and new ideas and impulses for emerging trends in future mobility.**

**One of the fellows that we are looking for will have expertise in full-stack automotive software development and a passion for learning and sharing their knowledge with others.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contribution options</span>:



* Design, develop and maintain full-stack automotive software solutions
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features
* Implement and maintain automotive software solutions in C++ and other programming languages
* Work with modern software development tools and practices such as Git, CI/CD, and Agile
* Write technical documentation and maintain an organized codebase
* Share knowledge and mentor others in the field of full-stack automotive software development

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Desired competencies</span>:



* 5+ years of experience in full-stack automotive software development
* Strong expertise in C++ and other programming languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
* Experience with inter-process communication (IPC) technologies such as CAN, FlexRay, or VSOMEIP. In automotive software engineering, several Inter-Process Communication (IPC) technologies are widely used and famous:
    * VSOMEIP: A communication stack specifically designed for automotive applications. It supports a wide range of platforms and helps in inter-process communication between different software components in an automotive system.
    * AUTOSAR COM: A standard communication interface provided by the AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) consortium, which supports different IPC techniques such as Pipes, Message Queues, Sockets, and Shared Memory.
    * DoIP (Diagnostic over Internet Protocol): A protocol used for diagnostic communication in vehicles and supports communication between the diagnostic tool and the vehicle's onboard diagnostic system.
    * CAN (Controller Area Network): A widely used protocol in automotive applications for communication between microcontrollers and other devices in a vehicle's system.
    * FlexRay: A high-speed communication protocol used in advanced automotive systems such as safety-critical systems, chassis systems, and powertrain systems.
    * MOST (Media Oriented Systems Transport): A bus system used in the automotive industry for in-car multimedia and entertainment systems.
    * LIN (Local Interconnect Network): A low-cost, simple serial communication protocol used in automotive applications such as sensors, actuators, and other devices.
* Knowledge of modern software development tools and practices such as Git, CI/CD, and Agile
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills
* Passion for teaching and sharing knowledge

This is an pro bono fellowship position within a non-profit educational organization, providing opportunities for personal skill development and for sharing your knowledge and achievements. For giving back to the broader community of software developers by helping new developers on their learning journey. And for co-driving new ideas and innovations - for a better and more exciting future of mobility - along with other experts and students. If you are an experienced full-stack automotive software developer seeking to expand your skills and make a positive impact, we want to hear from you.
