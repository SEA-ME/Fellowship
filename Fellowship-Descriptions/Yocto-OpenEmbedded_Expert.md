# Yocto / OpenEmbedded Expert


## Yocto / OpenEmbedded Expert Fellowship (pro bono) for a Non-Profit Educational Organization building an innovative mobility curriculum

We are an **innovative non-profit educational organization** seeking motivated and skilled software developers to join us as volunteer program fellows. Fellows are crucial for us in designing and maintaining the **first ever mobility software development curriculum that is based on peer-based learning** by students instead of teaching. 

*Research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria. Meanwhile, women or people with protected characteristics often only apply if they check every box. So if you feel you could be great for this role but don’t meet every single item on the list, please get in touch either way. We’d love to work out the potential together.*

Our new **“SEA:ME (Software Engineering in Automotive and Mobility Ecosystems)” curriculum builds on the tested peer-based learning system of the 42 Network** - and is the first advanced mobility curriculum that focuses broadly on diverse ecosystems of future (software-driven) mobility. Which include many different types of vehicles, modes, and services. And enable broader access to and choice of mobility for people of all backgrounds and environments. **I.e.: We code the future of mobility. And want to include as many experts / practitioners** from mobility companies as possible. 

**Volunteer fellows can also benefit from their participation** by becoming part of an expert community, exchanging knowledge, ideas and activities with colleagues from different companies / neighboring work fields - and by sharing in the ideas and innovation coming out of our community of students, experts, and staff. **We are specifically building our new curriculum on the basis of a lively community that drives both the successful learning of the students and new ideas and impulses for emerging trends in future mobility.**

**One of the fellows that we are looking for will have expertise in Yocto / OpenEmbedded development and a passion for learning and sharing their knowledge with others.**
