# Qt Expert


## Qt Expert Fellowship (pro bono) for a Non-Profit Educational Organization building an innovative mobility curriculum

We are an **innovative non-profit educational organization** seeking motivated and skilled software developers to join us as volunteer program fellows. Fellows are crucial for us in designing and maintaining the **first ever mobility software development curriculum that is based on peer-based learning** by students instead of teaching. 

Our new **“SEA:ME (Software Engineering in Automotive and Mobility Ecosystems)” curriculum builds on the tested peer-based learning system of the 42 Network** - and is the first advanced mobility curriculum that focuses broadly on diverse ecosystems of future (software-driven) mobility. Which include many different types of vehicles, modes, and services. And enable broader access to and choice of mobility for people of all backgrounds and environments. **I.e.: We code the future of mobility. And want to include as many experts / practitioners** from mobility companies as possible. 

**Volunteer fellows can also benefit from their participation** by becoming part of an expert community, exchanging knowledge, ideas and activities with colleagues from different companies / neighboring work fields - and by sharing in the ideas and innovation coming out of our community of students, experts, and staff. **We are specifically building our new curriculum on the basis of a lively community that drives both the successful learning of the students and new ideas and impulses for emerging trends in future mobility.**

**One of the fellows that we are looking for will have expertise in developing applications using Qt and a passion for learning and sharing their knowledge with others.**
