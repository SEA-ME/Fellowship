# V2C Technology Expert


## V2C Technology Expert Fellowship (pro bono) for a Non-Profit Educational Organization building an innovative mobility curriculum

We are an **innovative non-profit educational organization** seeking motivated and skilled software developers to join us as volunteer program fellows. Fellows are crucial for us in designing and maintaining the **first ever mobility software development curriculum that is based on peer-based learning** by students instead of teaching. 

*Research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria. Meanwhile, women or people with protected characteristics often only apply if they check every box. So if you feel you could be great for this role but don’t meet every single item on the list, please get in touch either way. We’d love to work out the potential together.*

Our new **“SEA:ME (Software Engineering in Automotive and Mobility Ecosystems)” curriculum builds on the tested peer-based learning system of the 42 Network** - and is the first advanced mobility curriculum that focuses broadly on diverse ecosystems of future (software-driven) mobility. Which include many different types of vehicles, modes, and services. And enable broader access to and choice of mobility for people of all backgrounds and environments. **I.e.: We code the future of mobility. And want to include as many experts / practitioners** from mobility companies as possible. 

**Volunteer fellows can also benefit from their participation** by becoming part of an expert community, exchanging knowledge, ideas and activities with colleagues from different companies / neighboring work fields - and by sharing in the ideas and innovation coming out of our community of students, experts, and staff. **We are specifically building our new curriculum on the basis of a lively community that drives both the successful learning of the students and new ideas and impulses for emerging trends in future mobility.**

**One of the fellows that we are looking for will have expertise in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies and a passion for learning and sharing their knowledge with others, including IoT and cloud computing.**

V2C technology is a rapidly evolving field that enables vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and other devices to enhance safety, efficiency, and comfort. The successful candidate will have experience in designing, developing, and implementing V2X solutions and a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities in this space, including the integration of IoT and cloud computing technologies.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Contribution options</span>:



* Design, develop, and maintain V2X communication solutions for various applications, incorporating IoT and cloud technologies as needed
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features
* Implement and maintain algorithms for V2X communication
* Write technical documentation and maintain an organized codebase
* Share knowledge and mentor others in the field of V2X communication and its integration with IoT and cloud computing

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Desired competencies</span>:



* 5+ years of experience in V2X communication development, including experience with IoT and cloud technologies
* Strong expertise in programming languages such as C++ or others
* In-depth knowledge of V2X communication technologies, algorithms, and development practices
* Experience with popular V2X communication platforms and tools, such as AUTOSAR, ROS, or others
* Knowledge of modern software development tools and practices such as Git, CI/CD, and Agile, as well as IoT and cloud computing technologies and their integration with V2X communication
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills
* Passion for teaching and sharing knowledge in the context of V2X communication and its integration with IoT and cloud computing

This is an pro bono fellowship position within a non-profit educational organization, providing opportunities for personal skill development and for sharing your knowledge and achievements. For giving back to the broader community of software developers by helping new developers on their learning journey. And for co-driving new ideas and innovations - for a better and more exciting future of mobility - along with other experts and students. If you are an experienced V2X Technology Expert seeking to expand your skills and make a positive impact, we want to hear from you.
