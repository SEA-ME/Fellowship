# SEA:ME Fellowships
## Join our expert, innovation and learning community around Software Engineering in Automotive & Mobility Ecosystems (SEA:ME)
* Team up with passionate experts from VW, CARIAD, Microsoft, MBition, Eclipse Foundation Software-defined Vehicle community as well as professors and researchers from technical universities.
* Enjoy our Open Innovation & Open Education environment without bureaucracy but with lots of entrepreneurial peers.
* Connect to talented next generation coders and evolve open source training materials that can be used in your organisation, universities and industry.

## What is a fellowship program?
We are an innovative non-profit higher-education organization building the first comprehensive training curriculum for automotive and mobility software developers. Your expertise and support will impact aspiring coders to thrive in their careers.
We are building a network of professionals to guide and mentor our students. Whether you are an expert software engineer providing technical guidance, a manager or a recruiting pro offering career support and advice, your contribution will be valuable.
Fellows can engage in the following activities:
* **Mentoring.** Our Mentorship Program provides inspiration, career advice, and motivation to aspiring coders on a 1:1 basis to help them achieve their career goals. In the mentorship kick-off you will find a match based on what you can offer and the respective students' needs. In addition, we offer career support sessions to help students to find suitable job opportunities and prepare for coding interviews. You can join our regular Fellowship events and participate in a vibrant community of like-minded professionals.
* **Internships.** Our Internship Program offers 4-6-month coding internships with the majority receiving job offers - even before graduation based on high recommendation rates from their mentors.
* **Learning and Development.** Our Learning and Development Program involves collaboration on Communities of Practice, Open Educational Resources, Micro-Trainings and Innovation Projects to foster lifelong learning and development.

As SEA:ME Fellows, you volunteer from **2 hrs per month** to **8 hrs per week** to collaborate on learning and innovation projects. Right now you are invited to contribute to the development of our new master-level 12-month open source curriculum that trains students in all areas and modes of mobility via 3 modules: 

* **Embedded Systems** - This module brings together educational projects around distributed computing systems architecture in a modern vehicle. We are looking for fellows with expertise in embedded operating systems (e.g. Embedded Linux, QNX), programming languages (C, C++, Python), microcontrollers (RPis, Arduinos, ARM, Nvidia), communication protocols (CAN, FlexRay, MOST, LIN), understanding of connectivity technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, Zigbee), sensors and actuators (GPS, cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, ultrasonic), HMI (touchscreens, buttons, voice recognition).

* **Autonomous Driving** - In this module students learn in projects about lane keeping assist (LKA) system, adaptive cruise control (ACC) system, obstacle detection and avoidance, park assistance system, traffic sign recognition system. You are very welcome to share your expertise in ADAS systems, computer vision, AI/ML algorithms, sensor fusion, robotics and simulation technologies (such as Carla, Gazebo, MATLAB)  with us to shape and evolve these exciting peer learning projects!

* **Mobility Ecosystems** - Here we are looking for peers with expertise in cloud computing technologies (such as OpenStack, Microsoft Azure and deploying/managing applications in the cloud), data engineering concepts and technologies (such as data storage, data processing, and data analysis, as well as experience with databases such as PostgreSQL, NoSQL), microservices architecture (knowledge of microservices architecture and experience building and deploying microservices-based applications) will be utilized to create cool educational projects focusing on V2C and V2X based features.

The SEA:ME is in collaboration with our partners from the Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) project at the Eclipse foundation. Through this partnership we will transpose cutting edge open source projects from SDV into open peer-training materials. 

Next to pioneering the SEA:ME learning projects, Fellows are invited to:
Engage in fun projects like developing a self-driving Käfer or an indoor-drone navigation system for an artistic drone-dance project
Use SEA:ME as a platform for open knowledge sharing and expert exchange via our fellow gatherings, workshops and hackathons.

Please [take 10 min to fill out the Fellow Application form](https://seame.space/become-a-fellow/). We will get back swiftly with how you can hit the ground, get to know your peer 42 SEA:ME Fellows and our students.

### We are currently looking for experts in the following areas:

*Research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria. Meanwhile, women or people with protected characteristics often only apply if they check every box. So if you feel you could be great for this role but don’t meet every single item on the list, please get in touch either way. We’d love to work out the potential together.*
