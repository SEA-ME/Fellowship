# SEA:ME Fellowships


## Join our expert, innovation and learning community around Software Engineering in Automotive & Mobility Ecosystems (SEA:ME)


* Team up with passionate experts from VW, CARIAD, Microsoft, MBition, Eclipse Software-defined Vehicle community as well as professors and researchers from technical universities.
* Enjoy our Open Innovation & Open Education environment without bureaucracy but lots of entrepreneurial peers.
* Connect to talented next generation coders and evolve open source training materials that can be used in your organisation, universities and industry     \

*Research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria. Meanwhile, women or people with protected characteristics often only apply if they check every box. So if you feel you could be great for this role but don’t meet every single item on the list, please get in touch either way. We’d love to work out the potential together.*

We are an innovative non-profit higher-education organization building the first comprehensive training curriculum for automotive and mobility software developers. As SEA:ME Fellows, you volunteer from 2h per month to 8 hours per week to collaborate on learning and innovation projects. Right now you are invited to contribute to the development of our new master-level 12-month open source curriculum that trains students in all areas and modes of mobility via 3 modules: 


* **Embedded Systems** - This module brings together educational projects around distributed computing systems architecture in a modern vehicle. We are looking for fellows with expertise in embedded operating systems (e.g. Embedded Linux, QNX), programming languages (C, C++, Python), microcontrollers (RPis, Arduinos, ARM, Nvidia), communication protocols (CAN, FlexRay, MOST, LIN), understanding of connectivity technologies (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, Zigbee), sensors and actuators (GPS, cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, ultrasonic), HMI (touchscreens, buttons, voice recognition).

* **Autonomous Driving** - In this module students learn in projects about lane keeping assist (LKA) system, adaptive cruise control (ACC) system, obstacle detection and avoidance, park assistance system, traffic sign recognition system. You are very welcome to share your expertise in ADAS systems, computer vision, AI/ML algorithms, sensor fusion, robotics and simulation technologies (such as Carla, Gazebo, MATLAB)  with us to shape and evolve these exciting peer learning projects!

* **Mobility Ecosystems** - Here we are looking for peers with expertise in cloud computing technologies (such as OpenStack, Microsoft Azure and deploying/managing applications in the cloud), data engineering concepts and technologies (such as data storage, data processing, and data analysis, as well as experience with databases such as PostgreSQL, NoSQL), microservices architecture (knowledge of microservices architecture and experience building and deploying microservices-based applications) will be utilized to create cool educational projects focusing on V2C and V2X based features.

The SEA:ME is in collaboration with our partners from the Software-defined Vehicle (SDV) project at the Eclipse foundation. Through this partnership we will transpose cutting edge open source projects from SDV into open peer-training materials. 

Next to pioneering the SEA:ME learning projects, Fellows are invited to:

* Mentor students and win them for internships and jobs in their organisation
* Engage in fun projects like developing a self-driving Käfer or an indoor-drone navigation system for an artistic drone-dance project
* Use our lab/space as a platform for open knowledge sharing and expert exchange via our SEA:ME symposia, Fellow Gatherings, workshops and hackathons.
